Application-Mover
=================

Simple system tray application to attach a keyboard shortcut in order to move your selected application to the next monitor on the list. This started out as a project for myself to learn more about C# Handles and PInvokes (platform invokes) and was inspired by UltraMon (which is useless at Windows 8 because it already supports several taskbars). It turned out to be useless because Windows already has a shortcut key for it.
